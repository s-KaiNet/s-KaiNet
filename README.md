My name is Sergei.   

I'm Microsoft MVP (Office Development) working mostly as a developer and consultant with Microsoft 365 technology stack. Over 10 years of experience in the industry.  
When I have free time, I contribute to my own or community GitHub projects.  

You can find the list of my most interesting projects pinned below.
